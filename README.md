Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
-it has played a crucial role in the technology industry in developing software applications and systems crucial in many aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-Development of programming languages for instance C
-software engineering was established as a discipline allowing people to study it
-The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  -Requirements: Gather and document the needs of the user and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall methodologies involve a sequential approach having distinct phases while Agile methodoligies on the other hand involve iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. 

-Waterfall methodologies useful for making software whose development cannot be broken into smaller parts. Agile methodologies better suited for complex software and each team is assigned a specific task to accomplish 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  - Software Developer: writes code and implements software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: makes sure software meets the expected quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: in charge of the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  - System Architect: Designs the overall structure and architecture of software systems.
  - UI/UX Designer: responsible for creating user interfaces and designs user experiences for software applications.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse.  

-Version Control Systems (VCS)track changes to source code and coordinate work among teams (e.g., Git, Subversion).
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  - Change in Requirements: software engineers can adopt agile methodologies which are able to adapt to change quickly.
  - Tight Deadlines: can be overcome by task prioritization
  - Technical Debt:can be overcome by regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

 - Unit Testing: involves Testing individual components or modules of software to ensure that each component of software works and its easier to point out the errors
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. to ensure that software works optimally with the components it was designed for
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. to make sure that it works
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- it involves crafting questions for AI to ensure that one gets the best possible response from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

-Vague: How to make food?

-Improved: what is the recipe for egg fried rice?

-the improved prompt is specific about the food that the person wants to make and they can therefore get a response that is useful to their needs.
